### Frontend
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstap)
* JavaScript (Mustache Templates Lib)
### Backend
* Flask
* SQLalchemy
* MySQL

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Javascript vs Jinja2**: We chose JavaScript for the frontend as it runs natively on the client browser, reducing the load on the backend server.

2. **SQLalchemy vs MySQLdb**: We opted for SQLalchemy as the ORM due to its user-friendliness and abstraction, eliminating the need to write raw SQL statements.
