### Frontend
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript - Mustache Templates Lib
### Backend
1. Flask
2. SQLalchemy
3. MySQL

## Alternatives Considered
1. Javascript vs Jinja2
We chose JavaScript for the frontend as it runs natively on the client browser, reducing the load on the backend server.

2. SQLalchemy vs MySQLdb
We opted for SQLalchemy as the ORM due to its user-friendliness and abstraction, eliminating the need to write raw SQL statements.
