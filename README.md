# WeOutSide - Events Catalog
## Project Overview
WeOutSide is an events catalog that aims to provide users with a comprehensive listing of events happening in their town. The platform focuses on user reviews and experiences to hold organizers accountable. With a ranking system and reviews, users can make informed decisions about attending events based on ratings and geolocation activities of the event venue. The catalog covers a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
### Backend
1. Flask
2. SQLalchemy
3. MySQL

## Alternatives Considered
1. Javascript vs Jinja2
We chose JavaScript for the frontend as it runs natively on the client browser, reducing the load on the backend server.

2. SQLalchemy vs MySQLdb
We opted for SQLalchemy as the ORM due to its user-friendliness and abstraction, eliminating the need to write raw SQL statements.
